Evelyn and I both got great looks at this sapsucker that was still in juvenile plumage.  The scapulars were dark and the bird showed large white wing patches as found on sapsuckers.  The back and breast had golden buff coloration with barring forming a distinct pattern that was quite beautiful.  The coloration faded gradually from the upper to the lower areas of the breast and back.  The crown showed some red that was broken by light and dark feathers.  A facial patch did not have red in it and was suffused with lighter feathers so that it was not a solid dark black.  It was offset by a line of off white below and above.  Behind this patch there was light streaking that blended away on the hind neck.  The throat showed red, white and a bit of brown coloration blended together.  The breast was barred with more color to the unbarred areas on the upper breast.  The barring on the back disappeared in the rump area.  We called out what we were seeing as we watched this bird.  It was an exciting find.  This is a species I was familiar with from birding in the mid-west for 10 years.

It was chasing/harrassing a ring-billed gull for most of that time. The bird appears to be a light phase breeding adult. Although the photos are not definitive, most of the field marks that can be made out seem to point to Parasitic. These include: prolonged chasing behavior, deep & fairly fast wingbeats, wing base that appears narrower than Pomarine, extensive white on the underside primaries, "white flash" present in the primaries when viewed from above (rare on other jaegers) and contrasting black underwing compared to the primaries, unlike long-tailed which should appear a uniform gray on the underwing. I lost contact with it as it was flying across the reservoir and couldn't relocate it, although I remained in the area for an hour and then checked several other access points on the reservoir. Can't say with 100% certainty that it was a Parasitic, but seems most likely to me based on the scant photo evidence. Photos attached.
