## Coarse Goals & Description

Programming is becoming a part of every day research in nearly every field.
This course aims to provide practical programming experience to familiarize
researchers with common software engineering concepts.  This is done by
implementing a well-defined project that is relatable to the researchers.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students should be able to understand the general
concepts of software engineering and common technologies used in software
engineering.  These include:

- Project management (planning)
- Source control (git)
- Documentation/comments
- Functions and testing
- Finding answers on the web (and decoding them)
- Changing software incrementally (without breaking it)
- General software engineering practices

## Course Format

The course will be taught in a workshop format, with students working along
with the instructor while programming.

## Pre and Co-requisites

No formal pre-requisites.  In order to hit the ground running, it is best to
have `git`, Microsoft VS Code, and the Go programming language installed (see
links [below](#Week_1)).

## Materials & Texts

No required texts.  Some reading material are linked below.

## Course Requirements

### Assignments

Students will have one assignment for each lecture.  The assignments will
require using the processes learned in lecture that week.

## Grading Information

- Assignments: XX%
- Participation: XX%

## Course Expectations

Since the bulk of the course is hands-on programming, attendance is crucial.
Please come ready to program.  If you have a laptop, bring it.  If not, the
lab computers will have the required tools available.

## Student Conduct & Academic Integrity

In order to create a safe space for learning, I expect all of us (peer mentors,
students, and myself) to exhibit behavior that reflects Boise State's Statement
of Shared
Values(https://deanofstudents.boisestate.edu./statement-of-shared-values/) and
is characterized by

- Academic Excellence
- Caring
- Citizenship
- Fairness
- Respect
- Responsibility
- Trustworthiness

In addition, students in this course are expected to uphold standards outlined
in the Boise State University Student Code of Conduct
(https://deanofstudents.boisestate.edu/student-code-of-conduct/).  Any work
submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the students
own work, or work of collaboration between one or more students.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities needing accommodations to fully participate in this
class should contact the Educational Access Center (EAC). All accommodations
must be approved through the EAC prior to being implemented.  To learn more
about the accommodation process, visit the EACâ€™s website at
https://eac.boisestate.edu/new-eac-students/.

## Planning for Success

We are working together to learn the *process* of programming.  Participate,
and be interactive in the course and with each other.

## Tentative Course Calendar

Week 1: Computers, project definition, and our first web server

Week 2: Importing eBird data into a relational database and writing queries

Week 3: Defining and writing a web service and documenting our work

Week 4: Testing and refining our service

Week 5: Adding more functionality to our service (query in time and space), and securing it

Week 6: Accessing our web service externally (consuming)

Week 7: Using our service in research

Week 8: Reflection/Overview
